# Global-Youtube-Analytics-Tableau

This project is a YouTube Analytics Dashboard designed in Tableau to analyze YouTube content performance, audience demographics, and revenue trends. It helps businesses, content creators, and advertisers make data-driven decisions by visualizing key metrics such as subscribers, uploads, video views, earnings, and engagement.

# Dataset & Data Sources
The dataset includes metrics like video views, subscribers, earnings, country-wise performance, category-wise engagement, and demographic insights. The data is sourced from YouTube API, web scraping, and CSV datasets containing creator performance details.

# Tools & Techniques Used
I used Tableau for interactive data visualization and SQL for data preprocessing. To optimize performance, I leveraged data extracts, calculated fields, and LOD expressions. Additionally, I performed trend analysis and A/B testing recommendations to improve YouTube monetization strategies.

# Key Features & Insights
The dashboard provides multiple insights, including:

YouTube Count by Gender: Shows male vs. female content creators' distribution.
1. Video Views by Country: Identifies top-performing regions (e.g., USA, India, Russia).
2. Video Views by Category: Highlights engagement across different niches (e.g., Music, Gaming, Education).
3. Earnings by YouTuber: Compares revenue trends for top creators.
4. Monthly Earnings & Uploads: Tracks revenue and upload frequency over time.
5. Age-wise Analysis: Breaks down subscribers by age groups for audience targeting.
